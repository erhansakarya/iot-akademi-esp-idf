        help
            Specifies the time interval in milliseconds between Wi-Fi beacon transmissions.
    
            Default: 100 ms
    
            Explanation:
            - A lower beacon interval results in faster device detection but higher power consumption.
            - 100 ms is a good balance for most ESP32 applications.

    config WIFI_AP_BANDWIDTH
        choice "Wi-Fi AP Bandwidth"
            default WIFI_BW_HT20
            help
                Specifies the bandwidth for the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP).
    
                Options:
                - HT20 (20 MHz): Default option. Provides better compatibility with most devices
                  and minimizes interference with neighboring networks.
                - HT40 (40 MHz): Provides higher throughput but may increase interference with
                  other 2.4 GHz devices.
    
                Default: HT20
    
                Explanation:
                - 20 MHz (HT20) is recommended for environments with multiple overlapping networks,
                  as it reduces interference and provides a more stable connection.
                - 40 MHz (HT40) offers faster speeds but requires cleaner radio conditions to work effectively.
        config WIFI_BW_HT20
            bool "HT20 (20 MHz)"

            default WIFI_PS_NONE
            help
                Configures the power save mode for the Wi-Fi Station (STA).
    
                Options:
                - NONE (Default): Power saving is disabled. The device stays active to maintain
                  the best possible connection and performance.
                - MIN_MODEM: Power saving is enabled with minimal effect on modem activity.
                  Saves power by reducing the modem's active time while maintaining connectivity.
                - MAX_MODEM: Aggressive power saving mode. The modem is active only during data
                  transmission, maximizing power efficiency but potentially increasing latency.
    
                Default: NONE
    
                Explanation:
                - Power save mode can extend battery life but may affect network performance.
                - MIN_MODEM is suitable for devices requiring balanced performance and power efficiency.
                - MAX_MODEM is ideal for battery-operated devices where power consumption is critical.
